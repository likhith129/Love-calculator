Binary search:it is a more efficient algorithm than linear search because it has a complexity of O(logn) unlikelinear seach which has complaxity O(n)in binary search it repeatedly divides search the searching interval in half if
the tagrget value is less than midpoint we go to the left side if it is more than the midpoint we go to the right andfind for the target value


def bin_search(arr,target):
  left = 0
  right = len(arr) - 1
  while left <= right:
    mid = (left+right) // 2
    if arr[mid] == target:
      return mid
    elif arr[mid] < target:
      left = mid
    else:right = mid - 1
  return -1
numbers = [10,20,30,40,50]
print(bin_search(numbers,40))
